        A study done by Transparent Chennai has found that excessive garbage, sanitation and sewage are key issues which remain unsolved at slum areas in Besant Nagar and Royapuram. Nitya V Raman,
        Project Director, Transparent Chennai says that the aim of the project is to bring about accountability in governance. “We would like all recognised slum areas to be treated like other areas
        in the city,” she says.
The study found that Urur and Olcott Kuppam in Besant Nagar which houses a population of 4500 people has  eight dumpsters — these are either found damaged or overflowing. K Saravanan, fisherman and a
resident of the kuppam says that the garbage from the dumpsters are not removed on a daily basis and added that as a result the dumpsters are not in a condition to be used. “We have to make a representation 
to the authorities every day to make arrangements to clear up the garbage. The garbage thrown is on the rise every day, either the officials make it a point to come once a week or never turn up,” he said.
K Gopinathan, Head, Urur Kuppam says that the issue of garbage being thrown right at the shore of the sea has been highlighted to officials. “We have now written to the mayor seeking help,” he said.
Prem Kumar, Head, Olcott Kuppam says both the slum areas share the problem of garbage and sewage in common.Saravanan adds that the excessive surface garbage is also causing diseases to residents of the area
which continues to pose a growing danger to the people living in the Kuppam. “Some of the residents were found to have cholera. This is now beginning to have an effect on the residents as well,” he says
The study also points out that public sanitation is a major cause of concern in Urur and Olcott Kuppam. Out of the 11 public toilets in Besant Nagar, only two were deemed usable. Out of the two, one toilet
is situated in Urur and Olcott Kuppam. This toilet was found to have been not been repaired since the time it was damaged by the Tsunami in 2004.Nithya Raman says that the the problem lies in governance.
“When the survey was carried out in Ward 176 (Besant Nagar), we found that the method in which governance was carried was unequal — as in certain areas got the services needed but areas like Urur Kuppam,
which is a recognised slum did not get the requiredservices and this was directly harming the residents,” she says.<br/>
